# Gemini Nutrition Tracking App

## Overview
The **Gemini Nutrition Tracking App** is a web application built using Streamlit and Google's Gemini API. The app allows users to upload or select an image of food and receive detailed nutritional information, including a calorie breakdown for each food item detected.

## Features
- Upload an image of food or select one from the sidebar.
- Uses **Google Gemini API** to analyze the image and extract nutritional details.
- Displays a structured breakdown of food items along with their respective calorie counts.
- User-friendly UI with a visually appealing background and layout.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Backend Logic)
- **Streamlit** (Web Framework)
- **Google Gemini API** (AI Model for Image Analysis)
- **PIL (Pillow)** (Image Processing)
- **Requests** (Fetching Images from URLs)
- **Dotenv** (Environment Variable Management)
